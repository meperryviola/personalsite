<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I'm a Senior Research Assistant for the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. My interests include labor and public economics, econometrics, technical and scientific communication, and community organizing. In my spare time, I'm a violist and classical soprano.</p>
<p>
I earned my BA in Economics and Mathematics from the University of Virginia in June 2022. I'm a native resident of Norfolk, Virginia and began my education at Old Dominion University in the fall of 2018, where I researched climate risk communication and simulation games as spaces for collective policy determination. I then transferred to UVA in the fall of 2019, where I developed a passion for econometric analysis.
I wrote my undergraduate thesis in Economics on the impacts of variable access to child care subsidies on the labor market behavior and welfare program participation of very low-income parents.I also worked with Leora Friedberg (UVA) and Tony Webb (The New School), assisting with research relating to retired individuals and various Social Security provisions.

In my off-hours, Iâ€™m training for a half marathon, reading for pleasure, and playing the viola!
